'Classic Corsa Redux'(V2):
A keyboard designed as a homage to the original custom keyboards, specifically the Korean OTD keyboards machined from metal; like those designed by eungsam where the typing angle emerged from the keyboard case and not the keyboard feet.

If you take these files to a manufacturer they should be able to CNC a keyboard made from aluminum, brass, copper, steel, PC etc.
I can recommend Shenzhen Dadesin Prototype Co, Ltd. (aka Dadesin; aka DDS):
https://dadesin.en.alibaba.com/
I have used them as my manufacturing partner for all my keyboard projects, you can see examples of their work on my instagram: https://www.instagram.com/designedbydark/
Reliable, extremely good quality, have integrity; will accept orders as low as 1 unit without expectations of a larger manufacturing order and they don't take too long to deliver.
It doesn't benefit me if someone uses one manufacturer or another. I'm not liable for which manufacturer someone chooses to use, or any issues/damages that occur due to that decision. 

You will also need a compatible keyboard plate, a compatible pcb, switches, keycaps that support a 7u spacebar, stabilisers compatible with a 7u spacebar to build it yourself. 
You will probably need to clip the switches into the plate/stabilisers into the PCB before soldering the switches to the PCB.
There are guides on the internet if you are unsure of what that means or how you would go about doing that.

I have listed plate and PCB compatibility further down in the readme.
Although the Jane V2 plate is readily available,
I will also be releasing a keyboard plate to use with the keyboard, but on a non commercial license instead.

Consists of:
Keyboard Topcase (which would be normally CNCed from aluminium and then sandblasted/anodised)
Keyboard Bottomcase (which would be normally CNCed from aluminium and then sandblasted/anodised)
Keyboard Weight (Which would normally be CNCed from brass, copper or steel, then either sandblasted, brushed or polished)

PCB compatibility:
Anubis by Gondolindrim
WT80/graphite by WilbaTech

Plate compatibility:
Ecliptica plate/designedbydark top mount
Jane V2 plate/Koala top mount

Manufacturer's mark:
You are required to have the manufacturer put their own maker's mark on the inside of the keyboard; replacing the existing placeholder written in chinese.
This allows buyers to have an understanding of quality and expectations of value/price based on the manufacturer used.
Bad actors who don't subscribe to this ettiquette, whether sellers or manufacturers, can then be avoided by the community for their untrustworthiness.

ECLIPTICA PLATE
A plate designed for the 'berserk-themed' Ecliptica project in memory of Miura, with a top mount variation designed by Dark.
This variation of top mount was designed by me to provide a relief/rebound on the typing experience not present with a standard top mount configuration.

The plate as provided should only be used for metal plates and not plastic ones. The cuts around the mounting points should be removed if making a version made from plastic.
The most common choice of plate material would be aluminium. I typically use the 5052 alloy when I get plates produced.

You can pay a manufacturer to make it for you, but you can't sell it to other people for profit or otherwise use this plate file or any continuations/derivatives for commercial reasons.
You may be able to lead a 'group buy' if you can prove that you aren't profiting/there isn't margin involved.
You cannot claim this work as your own, even after transforming, remixing, lifting, or any other continuation of this source design; you must reference and link to these open source files when using them.
If adaptation, credit indicating Work has been used and reasonable steps taken to identify that changes were made to the original. Even if changed through potentially unlimited cycles of iterations by different parties, the final file still inherits the licensing conditions outlined here.
No one can escape the non-commerical nature of this design in any continuations, derivatives or transformations.
