Open sourced and non-commerically released keyboards designedbydark.

   My username on twitch was 'darkheavenlight', a quote from Romeo and Juliet. 

   People in the community shortened it to 'Dark' and that's how I ended up with that name.

'Classic Corsa Redux' (V2):

A keyboard designed as a homage to the original custom keyboards, specifically the Korean OTD keyboards machined from metal; like those designed by Eungsam where the typing angle emerged from the keyboard case and not the keyboard feet.

If you take these files to a manufacturer they should be able to CNC a keyboard made from aluminum, brass, copper, steel, PC etc.

You should be able to open these .step files using CAD software like Fusion360 or similar to inspect, personalise and change them. 

I have linked a few images for those who won't do this.

***

Some specs:

   7 degree typing angle
   
   Under 17mm adjusted front height without bumpons
   
   Compatible with SJ5302 bumpons which are 8mm diameter and made by 3M
   
   WK (Winkey) and WKL (Winkeyless) Topcase versions available
   
   Bottomcase with 'OTD 360c' homage styling
   
   'Through' Weight, which gives the illusion of being two separate weights externally

PCB compatibility:
   
   Anubis by Gondolindrim
   
   WT80/graphite by WilbaTech

Plate compatibility:

   Jane V2 (top mount). Some versions may support Alps, but usually this plate support MX switches only.
   
   Ecliptica plate (top mount variation designedbydark), which is also released here, but on a non-commercial license. MX switches only.

***

Manufacturer's Mark:

   I'd like to enable buyers and the community to be able to more easily judge the quality/finishing they can expect from these keyboards.

   As a requirement we should ask the manufacturer to put their own maker's mark on the inside of the keyboard; replacing the existing placeholder written in chinese.

   This should enable us to more easily weigh up the value/price based on the manufacturer used.
   
   Bad actors who don't subscribe to this ettiquette, whether sellers or manufacturers, can then be more easily recognised and avoided.

***

Recommendation:

   I can recommend Shenzhen Dadesin Prototype Co, Ltd. (aka Dadesin; aka DDS):
   https://dadesin.en.alibaba.com/

   I have used them as my manufacturing partner for all my keyboard projects, you can see examples of their work on my instagram:
   https://www.instagram.com/designedbydark/

   In my personal experience they are reliable, the things they produce are of extremely good quality and they have integrity; will accept orders as low as 1 unit    without expectations of a larger manufacturing order and they don't take too long to deliver.

   It doesn't benefit me if someone uses one manufacturer or another.

   I'm not liable for which manufacturer someone chooses to use, or any issues/damages that occur due to that decision.

You will also need a compatible keyboard plate, a compatible pcb, switches, keycaps that support a 7u spacebar, stabilisers compatible with a 7u spacebar to build it yourself. 

You will probably need to clip the switches into the plate/stabilisers into the PCB before soldering the switches to the PCB.

There are guides on the internet if you are unsure of what that means or how you would go about doing that.

If you haven't built a custom keyboard before, I strongly recommend finding one and following it.

ECLIPTICA PLATE

   A plate originally designed for the 'berserk-themed' Ecliptica project in memory of Miura, with a top mount variation designed by Dark.
   
   This variation of top mount was designed by me to provide a relief/rebound on the typing experience not present with a standard top mount configuration.

   The plate as provided should only be used for metal plates and not plastic ones. The cuts around the mounting points should be removed if making a version made from plastic.
   
   The most common choice of plate material would be aluminium. I typically use the 5052 alloy when I get plates produced.
