   When Blacksimon started streaming, my username on twitch was 'darkheavenlight', quoted from Romeo and Juliet. 

   Simon shortened it to 'Dark' and that's how I became known by that name.

THIRD RELEASE:
PART 1:
[Open Source Sixty (OSS) V2]

.USB port redone to fix any slight alignment issues

.Increased gap underneath screws for top-mounted configuration, by lowering a portion of the bottom case

.On the bottom left and right corner of the 'bottom case' added a small amount of material to increase the minimum thickness around the screws to 1mm. I apologise for this oversight and the time taken to correct it, I was burnt out and busy with other life events.

The keyboard should now be functional without alteration, but still has yet to be prototyped by myself for testing.

***
THIRD RELEASE:
PART 2: [Open Source Idol, aka Ex: Idol (F12 TKL)]

.Top mounted version of Ex Idol with both WK (Winkey) and WKL (Winkeyless) variants of the top-case included.

.Compatible with the WT-80 Wilba PCB, along with the Ecliptica PCB by Gondolindrim.

.An altered version of the 'ecliptica' top mount plate included, styled for this keyboard with hearts and other decoration. Keyboard is top-mounted only.

.Internally screwed using the standard 'screwless' implementation - NOT BAION BOLT at this time. Something similar may come later, TBC.

.9 degree typing angle

.No external engravings included

.Large through weight

.Chinese text indicating for the manufacturer to put their maker's mark/ name there to indicate who made the keyboard, along with 'designedbydark' and 'idol'. No other text within the keyboard proper, is included.

.M2.5 size, 6mm screws should be used for top mount/plate fastening as usual. M4 countersunk screws should be used for the weight, like maybe 3mm or 4mm length or longer, whatever the manu wants to do. Then the case screws should be 6mm length M2 screws, but taking M1.3 sized screwdrivers, if that makes sense. M1.3 sized driver, M2 screw. That confused me for a while when i was getting replacement screws, doh.

SECOND RELEASE: 
[Open Sourced Sixty (OSS)]
Released under the Apache License, Version 2.0: 
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

***
An open sourced sixty-percent layout keyboard, with a 'seamless wedge' styled side profile.
A basic keyboard with a few aesthetic refinements. 

I have taken care in the spacing and position of the screws, along with the proportions of curves and edges so that it is a level above that which you could expect from a keyboard sold at GB in the same style. 

The keyboard uses M3 sized hex screws for case fastening, and uses M2.5 button head screws for plate fastening if top-mounted. The plate was adapted from the original Visas design, but is no longer compatible with pure bumpon mounting.  

It is also compatible with o-ring mounting although that has yet to be tested. You will need to buy your own o-ring to use this mounting method. Unless you buy additional bumpons and an o-ring, then top mount is the default mounting method.   

The keyboard would also require you to buy your own SJ5302 M3 bumpons for the feet of the board, which also double as the required isolation on the top of the plate when using the o-ring mount.  

Compatible with the H60 PCB by hineybush and the Raphael 60% PCB by Gondolindrim.   

Typing angle is approx 5.9 degrees, the adjusted front height around 17.15mm.

'Classic Corsa Redux' (V2):

A keyboard designed as a homage to the original custom keyboards, specifically the Korean OTD keyboards machined from metal; like those designed by Eungsam where the typing angle emerged from the keyboard case and not the keyboard feet.

If you take these files to a manufacturer they should be able to make it for you on a much shorter timeline than you could expect when joining a groupbuy.

Typically the top and bottom cases will be CNCed from aluminium (6063, 7XXX, 6061, 5052 etc), sandblasted and anodised.

Typically the 'weight' piece would be CNCed from a material that adds weight to the assembly versus the top/bottom case materials; steel, copper or brass are the most common choices.

You should be able to open these .step files using CAD software like Fusion360 or similar to inspect, personalise and change them. 

In future releases I may attach a guide to help you add engravings of your own.

I have linked a few images of the keyboard so it can be previewed without opening the files.

Some specs:

   7 degree typing angle
   
   Under 17mm adjusted front height without bumpons
   
   Compatible with SJ5302 bumpons which are 8mm diameter and made by 3M
   
   WK (Winkey) and WKL (Winkeyless) Topcase versions available
   
   Bottomcase with 'OTD 360c' homage styling
   
   'Through' Weight, which gives the illusion of being two separate weights externally

PCB compatibility:
   
   Anubis by Gondolindrim
   
   WT80/graphite by WilbaTech

Plate compatibility:

   Jane V2 (top mount). Some versions may support Alps, but usually this plate support MX switches only.
   
   Ecliptica plate (top mount variation designedbydark), which is included in the first release, but on a non-commercial license. MX switches only.

***

Manufacturer's Mark:

   I'd like to enable buyers and the community to be able to more easily judge the quality/finishing they can expect from these keyboards.

   As a requirement we should ask the manufacturer to put their own maker's mark on the inside of the keyboard; replacing the existing placeholder written in chinese.

   This should enable us to more easily weigh up the value/price based on the manufacturer used.
   
   Bad actors who don't subscribe to this ettiquette, whether sellers or manufacturers, can then be more easily recognised and avoided.

***

Recommendation:

   I can recommend Shenzhen Dadesin Prototype Co, Ltd. (aka Dadesin; aka DDS):
   https://dadesin.en.alibaba.com/

   I have used them as my manufacturing partner for all my keyboard projects, you can see examples of their work on my instagram:
   https://www.instagram.com/designedbydark/

   In my personal experience they are reliable, the things they produce are of extremely good quality and they have integrity; will accept orders as low as 1 unit    without expectations of a larger manufacturing order and they don't take too long to deliver.

   It doesn't benefit me if someone uses one manufacturer or another.

   I'm not liable for which manufacturer someone chooses to use, or any issues/damages that occur due to that decision. 

***

You will also need a compatible keyboard plate, a compatible pcb, switches, keycaps that support a 7u spacebar, stabilisers compatible with a 7u spacebar to build it yourself. 

You will probably need to clip the switches into the plate/stabilisers into the PCB before soldering the switches to the PCB.

There are guides on the internet if you are unsure of what that means or how you would go about doing that.

If you haven't built a custom keyboard before, I strongly recommend finding a guide/doing research and following it.

ECLIPTICA PLATE

   A plate originally designed for the 'berserk-themed' Ecliptica project in memory of Miura, with a top mount variation designed by Dark.
   
   This variation of top mount was designed by me to provide a relief/rebound on the typing experience not present with a standard top mount configuration.

   The plate as provided should only be used for metal plates and not plastic ones. The cuts around the mounting points should be removed if making a version made from plastic.
   
   The most common choice of plate material would be aluminium. I typically use the 5052 alloy when I get plates produced.
